#include <iostream>

// using namespace std;

int main() {
    // int file_size = 0;
    // int counter = 0;
    // double sales = 9.99;
    // std::cout << file_size;
    // return 0;


    // int a = 1;
    // using int in cpp is like using let in javascript
    // int b = 2;
    // int temp = a;
    // a = b;
    // b = temp;
    // this goes in a sequence so you set temp to a or 1 and then a to b so it makes it 2 and then once you set b to temp is makes b 1
    // so when you do cout or character out << a it says 2 and if you were to use b it would be 1 therefore swapping them
    // cout << a;

    // const double pi = 3.14;
    // by using the const it makes it so that the variable pi doesn't change so it will always be 3.14 and will throw an error if you try to change it
    // using double allows you to use decimals for the value given to the variable

    // int file_size; // Snake Case using lowercase letters
    // int FileSize; // Pascal Case uses uppercase for the first letters of the words
    // int fileSize; // Camel Case (I know what this is)
    // int iFileSize; // Hungarian Notation (old and not relevant)

    // int x = 10;
    // int y = 3;
    // int z = x + y;
    // std::cout << z;
    // by doing the above it will out put 13 when you run the program because it calls z which is x + y
    // if you want to do division and get a decimal to show you have to add a double instead of int infront of the z so it would be double z = x / y;
    // you also need to use a double for one of the variables aswell so you'd need to change x to  double x = 10; instead of
    // int x = 10
    // you can use x++ for incrementing or x-- for decrementing instead of doing x - 1 or x + 1
    // if you were to do std::cout << "z = " << z; it will use the string and chain it to z so it will say z = to whatever the value of z is when you run it
    // using std::endl; will start a new line so if you do
    // std:cout << "z = " << z << std::endl; and then a another std:cout underthat they will be on seperate lines when you run the program
    // or you can use on the next line of code << instead so on the next line you could use << "y = " << y; and remove
    // the ; from the std::endl;
    // by using.... using namespace std; like you see above it allows you to skip using std:: before the cout or end
    // so the next time you use it you can use cout or endl anywhere and not have to use std::cout or endl and just use cout or endl instead
